# HomeTruth - Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is HomeTruth?

HomeTruth is a Chrome extension that provides transparent, in-depth property information directly on UK property portals like Rightmove, Zoopla, OnTheMarket, and PrimeLocation. It helps you make informed decisions by revealing the truth behind property listings.

### Which UK property websites does HomeTruth work with?

HomeTruth currently works with Rightmove, Zoopla, OnTheMarket, and PrimeLocation. We're constantly expanding to support more UK property portals.

### Is HomeTruth available for browsers other than Chrome?

Currently, HomeTruth is only available for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. We're working on versions for Firefox and Safari.

### How much does HomeTruth cost?

HomeTruth offers a free tier with essential information and a Premium subscription for £4.99/month or £49.99/year, providing comprehensive property insights.

## Data and Information

### Where does HomeTruth get its property data from?

HomeTruth aggregates data from multiple UK sources, including:

- HM Land Registry for ownership and sales history
- Local authorities for planning and Council Tax information
- Environment Agency for flood risk data
- Office for National Statistics for demographic information
- Ordnance Survey for mapping and geographic data
- UK school performance data
- UK Crime Statistics

### How accurate is HomeTruth's property valuation?

Our property valuations typically fall within 5-10% of actual sale prices. The accuracy depends on available data and the property's uniqueness. We clearly indicate confidence levels with each valuation.

### How up-to-date is the information?

Most data is updated daily or weekly. Land Registry data may have a 4-6 week delay. Price history data is updated as soon as it becomes publicly available.

### Can HomeTruth show me if a property is freehold or leasehold?

Yes, HomeTruth displays tenure information (freehold/leasehold) when available. For leasehold properties, we provide lease length, ground rent, and service charge details where this information is publicly accessible.

## UK-Specific Features

### How does HomeTruth calculate Stamp Duty Land Tax?

HomeTruth uses the latest HMRC rates for England and Northern Ireland, Land Transaction Tax rates for Wales, and Land and Buildings Transaction Tax for Scotland. Our calculator considers first-time buyer relief and additional property surcharges.

### Does HomeTruth show Council Tax information?

Yes, HomeTruth displays the Council Tax band and estimated annual payment based on the property's location and the relevant local authority rates.

### Can HomeTruth show me schools in the catchment area?

Yes, HomeTruth displays nearby schools, their Ofsted ratings, and approximate catchment areas to help families make informed decisions.

### Does HomeTruth show planning permissions and restrictions?

Yes, HomeTruth displays planning history, including recent applications and decisions. We also highlight if a property is in a conservation area, is a listed building, or has other planning restrictions.

### Can HomeTruth tell me about flood risks for UK properties?

Yes, HomeTruth provides comprehensive flood risk data from the Environment Agency, covering river, sea, and surface water flooding risks.

### Does HomeTruth show information about property boundaries?

Yes, where Land Registry data is available, HomeTruth can provide information about property boundaries, though this should not replace official legal searches.

## Using HomeTruth

### What is the HomeTruth Trust Score?

The Trust Score is a number from 1-100 that indicates the overall reliability and value of a property listing. It's calculated using factors like price accuracy, property condition, potential issues, and listing transparency.

## Privacy and Security

### Does HomeTruth store my browsing history?

### Is my personal information secure?
