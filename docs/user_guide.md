## What HomeTruth Does

HomeTruth is a browser extension designed to empower home buyers. When a user visits a property listing page on major real estate websites (like Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, Trulia), the extension automatically activates.

- **Data Extraction**: It reads key information from the webpage: the property description, listed price, photos, address, features (bedrooms, bathrooms, area), etc.
- **Backend Analysis**: This extracted data is securely sent to the HomeTruth backend API.
- **AI & Data Processing**: The backend uses AI models (like OpenAI's) and potentially other external data sources to:
  - **Fact-Check**: Analyze claims made in the description for accuracy or potential exaggeration (e.g., "newly renovated," "quiet street").
  - **Analyze Photos**: Detect common photographic tricks like excessive wide-angle lens use or virtual staging that might misrepresent the space.
  - **Assess Pricing**: Compare the listing price against historical price changes for that property and recent sales of comparable nearby properties (comps).
  - **Evaluate Location**: Check nearby amenities (transit, shopping, schools, restaurants) and assess potential risks (flood zones, wildfire areas, crime rates, noise levels).
- **Display Insights**: The results of this analysis are sent back to the browser extension.
- **UI Injection**: The extension then displays these findings directly on the listing page, often as an overlay or an added section. This includes things like a "Trust Score," identified red flags, fact-check results, photo analysis notes, price comparisons, and location scores/warnings.
- **User Account (Optional)**: Users can potentially create accounts via a separate User Portal to manage preferences, view analysis history, and access premium features or subscription tiers.

In short: It acts as an AI-powered assistant that automatically analyzes real estate listings you browse, highlighting potential issues and providing objective data to help you see beyond the marketing hype.

Using HomeTruth is designed to be simple:

1. **Browse as Usual**: Navigate to a property listing page on a supported website (e.g., Zillow.com, Redfin.com, Realtor.com, Trulia.com).
2. **Automatic Analysis**: HomeTruth will automatically detect you're on a listing page and begin its analysis. You might see a small HomeTruth loading indicator appear briefly.
3. **View Insights**: Once the analysis is complete (usually takes a few seconds), the HomeTruth panel or overlay will appear on the page. This panel contains the insights gathered about the listing.
4. **Explore the Sections**: The HomeTruth panel is typically organized into sections like:
   - **Summary**: An overview, often including a "Trust Score," key highlights, and major red flags detected.
   - **Fact Check**: Details on claims made in the property description and HomeTruth's assessment of their validity (e.g., "True," "Misleading," "Unverifiable").
   - **Photo Analysis**: Notes on detected photography techniques (e.g., "Wide-angle lens detected," "Potential virtual staging").

### 3. Understanding the Analysis

- **Trust Score**: A rating (e.g., 0-100) indicating the overall perceived transparency and reliability of the listing based on our analysis. Higher scores are better.
- **Assessments**: Look for terms like "True," "Misleading," "False," or "Unverifiable" in the Fact Check section, along with explanations.
- **Scores**: Location and risk factors are often presented as scores (e.g., 0-10). Pay attention to whether a high score is good (like amenities) or bad (like risk).

- Premium subscription options might be available, offering enhanced analysis, more detailed data, or higher usage limits. You can manage your account and subscription through the HomeTruth User Portal (link usually provided in the extension or on the website).

### 5. Troubleshooting

#### HomeTruth panel not appearing?

- Ensure you are on a supported website's specific property listing page (not just the search results).
- Try refreshing the page.
- Check if the HomeTruth extension is enabled in your browser's extension settings.

#### Analysis seems slow?

- The analysis involves complex AI processing and data fetching, which can take a few moments, especially on the first visit to a listing.

#### Incorrect analysis?

- AI and data analysis are powerful but not perfect. If you believe something is wrong, look for a feedback option within the extension or contact support.
