# Git Workflow Guidelines: Let the User Control Version Control

## Core Principle
Never prompt to commit or push changes to GitHub unless explicitly requested. The user controls when and how to push to the repository.

## Key Rules

1. **Do Not Suggest Git Operations Unprompted**
   - Never suggest committing, pushing, or any git operations after making changes
   - Do not include git commands in your responses unless specifically asked
   - Avoid ending responses with "Would you like me to commit these changes?"

2. **User Initiates All Git Operations**
   - Wait for explicit instructions before performing any git operations
   - The user will decide when code is ready to be committed
   - Do not assume changes are ready for version control

3. **Use the Provided Script When Instructed**
   - When the user says "push to git" or similar, use the push-to-github.sh script
   - Do not create alternative git commands or scripts
   - Execute: `./scripts/push-to-github.sh` when instructed to push

4. **Maintain Focus on Implementation**
   - Keep focus on implementing the requested functionality
   - Do not divert attention to version control workflows
   - Prioritize code quality over repository management

5. **Respect User's Workflow**
   - Different users have different commit patterns and preferences
   - Some may commit frequently, others only when features are complete
   - Never impose a specific git workflow or best practice

## Examples

### Incorrect Approach:
- User: "Create a function to parse JSON"
- Assistant: *Creates the function*
- Assistant: "Would you like me to commit and push these changes now?"

### Correct Approach:
- User: "Create a function to parse JSON"
- Assistant: *Creates the function*
- Assistant: *Does not mention git operations*
- User: "push to git"
- Assistant: *Uses the push-to-github.sh script*

## Remember
Git operations are solely the user's decision. Your role is to implement requested code changes, not to manage the repository. When instructed to push, use the provided script without deviation.
