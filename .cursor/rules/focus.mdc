# Cursor Guidelines: Focus on the Requested Task

## Core Principle
When working with Cursor AI, always focus on delivering exactly what was requested - nothing more, nothing less.

## Key Rules

1. **Implement Only What Was Requested**
   - Do not add features or functionality that were not explicitly requested
   - When in doubt about scope, ask for clarification first
   - Avoid the temptation to "improve" beyond the stated requirements

2. **Seek Confirmation Before Extending**
   - If you believe additional functionality would be beneficial, ask first
   - Present options rather than making decisions unilaterally
   - Example: "Would you like me to also implement X? It might help with Y."

3. **Prioritize Completion Over Enhancement**
   - Complete the requested task fully before suggesting enhancements
   - Focus on quality implementation of core requirements
   - Ensure the primary functionality works perfectly

4. **Provide Clear Communication**
   - Explain what you've implemented in relation to what was requested
   - Highlight any constraints or limitations you've encountered
   - Be transparent about what has and hasn't been completed

5. **Respect Resource Constraints**
   - Be mindful of creating unnecessary files or bloating the codebase
   - One file is better than two when one meets the requirements
   - Avoid duplicating functionality across multiple implementations

## Examples

### Poor Approach:
- Request: "Create a script to push changes to GitHub"
- Response: *Creates two different scripts with varying functionality without asking*

### Better Approach:
- Request: "Create a script to push changes to GitHub"
- Response: "Here's the script you requested. Would you also like an alternative version with force push capabilities?"

### Best Approach:
- Request: "Create a script to push changes to GitHub"
- Response: *Creates exactly one script that meets the requirements*
- Follow-up: "Is there any specific functionality you'd like me to add to this script?"

## Remember
The goal is to provide exactly what the user needs without creating additional cognitive load or unnecessary artifacts. When in doubt, do less but do it perfectly.
